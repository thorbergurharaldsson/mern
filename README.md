# MERN stack

This is my first project using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, NodeJS), I created an api for the MongoDB with CRUD options.

For the frontend I decided to create a contact list since on that I can use CRUD in the REST API.

### TODO

- Add searchbar
- Add authentication
  - Personal contact list, based on user auth
